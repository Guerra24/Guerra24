### Hi, I'm Guerra24

I've been doing this since 2015 and my progression is not exactly the easiest one. The first language I learned was Java along with OpenGL/GLSL as my goal back then was to create a minecraft clone. More recently worked on my own game engine and then moved to [Anarchy Engine](https://github.com/orange451/AnarchyEngine) where I wrote the entire renderer.

I also hack around with bleeding-edge tools and software, probably my most well known contribution was running Ubuntu's Unity desktop inside WSL 1... yeah that was me.

Also have experience with Linux, deploying and managing servers with or without Docker. All my servers run Debian â™¥ 

Currently working on two projects: [Firefox-UWP-Style](https://github.com/Guerra24/Firefox-UWP-Style) a complete theme for Firefox with the style of UWP and [LRReader](https://github.com/Guerra24/LRReader) an UWP client for [LANraragi](https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi).

I know (kind of) Blender but more on the materials, lighting, rendering and compositing.

### Work

Currently working at `04641f5abe38298ca2259ca10184e70a053f0c2cfca3105f7c4590b4e3e126d7` as a Full Stack (NextJS + ASP.NET Core) developer and Lead DevOps.

Rewriting a big ASP.NET Web Forms app and upgrading its microservices to NET 6+.

Broke down and rebuilt up the entire development and deployment workflow by moving from a single SVN repo to a multi-repo GitLab instance with automated multi-environment deployment. Containerized legacy apps and its services, and new apps/services are container-ready from the beginning.

Everything running on top of a Docker Swarm cluster in a mixed environment of ARM64 Linux and X86 Windows instances.

<sub><sub>Btw Visual Basic is a PITA. Thank god the rewrite is C# only.</sub></sub>
